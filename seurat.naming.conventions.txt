// seurat conventions

Cell IDs:
- It is computationally beneficially to use the shortest possible cell IDs, i.e. [batch]_[cell barcode]
- It is suggested to use underscores in the cell IDs rather than periods or other special characters which may result in irregular matches when indexing by cell ID

meta data:
- only include relevant meta data in object
- use intuitive names
- for clustering, format as: "[assay]_clusters"
- for cell type annotations, format as: "[optional prefix]_cell_type"

reductions:
- Supported reductions are tSNE, UMAP, PCA and Diffusion
- format of reduction name: "[reduction key]_[assay]_[numder of dimensions]d"
  * where the reduction key is:
    - "tsne" for a tSNE
    - "umap" for a UMAP
    - "pca" for a PCA
    - "diff" for a Diffusion
  e.g. pca_rna_2d

- format cell.embeddings colnames as "[reduction key]_[assay]_[dim]_[component]"
	* where dim is either '2d' or '3d'
	* Use the seurat_reduc_key_name() function to do this automatically
